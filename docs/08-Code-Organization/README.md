# Code Organization and Feature Suggestions for Your Todo App

This document outlines completed refactoring tasks and suggests future improvements and features for your Todo application.

## Completed Refactoring

The following refactoring tasks have been successfully implemented:

*   ✅ **`useTodos` Hook:** Data fetching, state management, and core Todo logic have been extracted into the `useTodos` custom hook (or similar logic within `TodoListClient`). This separates presentation logic from state management and business logic.
*   ✅ **`TodoItem` Componentization:** The `TodoItem` has been designed as a focused component responsible for displaying and interacting with a single Todo.
*   ✅ **`TodoFilter` Modularity:** The `TodoFilter` component handles the display and interaction for filtering Todo items.
*   ✅ **Data Organization:** The `Todo` type is clearly defined in `src/types/todos.ts`, and initial data is managed in `src/lib/todo-data.ts`.

## Future Suggestions & New Features

Here are some suggestions for new features and further improvements:

*   **Add to Favorites:**
    *   Implement a "favorite" feature allowing users to mark and save their most important Todo items.
    *   This would likely involve:
        *   A "favorite" button or icon on each `TodoItem`.
        *   A mechanism to persist the list of favorites (e.g., using `localStorage`).
        *   A new state management hook (`useFavorites`) or an extension of the existing `useTodos` hook.
        *   A UI element, such as a new filter option or a dedicated "Favorites" toggle, to display the saved Todo items.

*   **Error Handling:** There is no explicit error handling in the current data handling logic. If data operations (e.g., saving to `localStorage` or a future API call) were to fail, the application might not handle it gracefully. Consider adding `try...catch` blocks or other error handling mechanisms.

*   **Loading State:** While a basic loading state might be present, consider enhancing it with a more sophisticated skeleton UI for `TodoItem` components to improve user experience during data fetching or processing.

*   **Testing Framework (High Priority):** The project currently has no automated tests, which is a critical risk for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. A testing framework is essential for confident refactoring and future development.

    *   **Proposed Solution:** Implement a testing suite using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
    *   **Implementation Plan:**

        **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
        1.  **Install Dependencies:** Add the required development dependencies using pnpm.
            ```bash
            pnpm add -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @types/jest ts-jest
            ```
        2.  **Configure Jest:** Create a `jest.config.js` file at the project root to configure Jest for a Next.js environment, including setting up the test environment, module aliases, and handling for static assets.
        3.  **Create Setup File:** Create a `jest.setup.js` file to import necessary polyfills or custom matchers, such as those from `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

        **Phase 2: Initial Tests**
        1.  **Add Test Script:** Add a `"test": "jest"` script to `package.json` to easily run the tests.
        2.  **Write a Component Test:** Create a test file for a simple, presentational component (e.g., `TodoItem.test.tsx`) to ensure it renders correctly.
        3.  **Write a Hook Test:** Create a test file for the `useTodos` hook (or the logic within `TodoListClient`) to verify that the data management and filtering logic works as expected under various conditions. This is crucial for ensuring the core functionality of the application is reliable.

*   **Code Duplication:** Review the codebase for any repetitive logic that could be extracted into reusable utility functions or custom hooks.

*   **Performance:** For a very large number of Todo items, client-side filtering and rendering could become a performance bottleneck. Consider looking into techniques like virtualization for lists or server-side pagination to improve performance.

## General Architectural Suggestions

*   **Adopt Atomic Design Principles:**
    *   Organize your components into `atoms`, `molecules`, and `organisms`. This will create a more consistent and scalable component library.
    *   **Atoms:** Basic UI elements like `Button`, `Input`, `Checkbox`.
    *   **Molecules:** Combinations of atoms, like a `TodoInput` (input + button).
    *   **Organisms:** More complex components like `TodoList` and `TodoFilter`.

By applying these suggestions, you can improve the modularity, reusability, and maintainability of your codebase.
